J48=-U\nUse unpruned tree.\n\n-C <pruning confidence>\nSet confidence threshold for pruning. (default 0.25)\n\n-M <minimum number of instances>\nSet minimum number of instances per leaf. (default 2)\n\n-R\nUse reduced error pruning.\n\n-N <number of folds>\nSet number of folds for reduced error pruning. One fold is used as pruning set. (default 3)\n\n-B\nUse binary splits only.\n\n-S\nDon't perform subtree raising.\n\n-L\nDo not clean up after the tree has been built.\n\n-A\nLaplace smoothing for predicted probabilities.\n\n-Q <seed>\nSeed for random data shuffling (default 1).
NaiveBayes=-K\nUse kernel density estimator rather than normal distribution for numeric attributes\n\n-D\nUse supervised discretization to process numeric attributes\n\n-O\nDisplay model in old format (good when there are many classes)
