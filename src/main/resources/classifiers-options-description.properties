J48=-U\nUse unpruned tree.\n\n-C <pruning confidence>\nSet confidence threshold for pruning. (default 0.25)\n\n-M <minimum number of instances>\nSet minimum number of instances per leaf. (default 2)\n\n-R\nUse reduced error pruning.\n\n-N <number of folds>\nSet number of folds for reduced error pruning. One fold is used as pruning set. (default 3)\n\n-B\nUse binary splits only.\n\n-S\nDon't perform subtree raising.\n\n-L\nDo not clean up after the tree has been built.\n\n-A\nLaplace smoothing for predicted probabilities.\n\n-Q <seed>\nSeed for random data shuffling (default 1).
NaiveBayes=-K\nUse kernel density estimator rather than normal distribution for numeric attributes\n\n-D\nUse supervised discretization to process numeric attributes\n\n-O\nDisplay model in old format (good when there are many classes)
SMO=-D\nIf set, classifier is run in debug mode and may output additional info to the console\n-no-checks\nTurns off all checks - use with caution! Turning them off assumes that data is purely numeric, doesn't contain any missing values, and has a nominal class. Turning them off also means that no header information will be stored if the machine is linear. Finally, it also assumes that no instance has a weight equal to 0.\n(default: checks on)\n-C <double>\nThe complexity constant C. (default 1)\n-N\nWhether to 0=normalize/1=standardize/2=neither. (default 0=normalize)\n-L <double>\nThe tolerance parameter. (default 1.0e-3)\n-P <double>\nThe epsilon for round-off error. (default 1.0e-12)\n-M\nFit logistic models to SVM outputs.\n-V <double>\nThe number of folds for the internal cross-validation. (default -1, use training data)\n-W <double>\nThe random number seed. (default 1)\n-K <classname and parameters>\nThe Kernel to use. (default: weka.classifiers.functions.supportVector.PolyKernel)
